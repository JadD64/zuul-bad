1. 
- This application allows us to play an interactive game using prompts.
- "help", "go", "quit", and other.
- go allows us to go the direction we want as we write the direction follow "go", quit allows us to put an end to the game,
help explains the context/setting of the game, and writing anything has the the terminal print saying it doesn't know what you mean.
- 5 rooms: lab, pub, theater, office, and outside
